    <h1>Joshmi Joseph</h1>
    <p> I am currently pursuing a masters in Human Factors Engineering and a certification in Computer Science. I have industry experience creating digital products as a Product Designer. I typically create websites through platforms like Figma, Squarespace, Wix, and Wordpress, but would like to become profecient in HTML/CSS. I took this class as I am interested in learning more about web development; not just the programming languages but also the technicalities involved with how the web works.</p>

        I like my Bagels and Lox on an everything bagel, with plain cream cheese, Lox and topped with capers. I do not like red onion or scallions on my Bagels and Lox. </p>
